## :interrobang: The Challenge

This is one of the challenges designed by Frontend Mentor in order to train and test my skills and knowledge using HTML and CSS. ðŸ”¥ðŸš€

This project is company stat card.

## :paperclip: Links:

- Solution URL: https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/stats-preview-card-component-yR1s7jCQAr
- Live Site URL: https://i-ramoss.github.io/stats-preview-card-component/

## :rocket: Built with:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Box shadow

## :gem: What I learned:

- Undoubtedly, one of the biggest challenges was to make this page responsive.
- I tested using grid at times but I was unsuccessful and ended up resorting to `flexbox`.
- One of my focuses now will be to learn how to develop very responsive websites in a practical way, in addition to better understanding how the `grid` works.

## :confetti_ball: How to contribute:

- Make a fork;
- Create a branch with your functionality: `git checkout -b <your_feature_name>`;
- Submit the changes made: `git commit -am 'type(scope): <description>'`;
- Push your branch: `git push origin <your_branch_name>`.

After your request is accepted and added to the project, you can delete your branch.
